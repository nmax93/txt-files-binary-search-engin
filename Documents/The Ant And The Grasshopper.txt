ONE HOT SUMMER'S DAY A GRASSHOPPER SAT ON A BLADE OF GRASS
ENJOYING THE SUNSHINE.
"WHAT A FINE DAY," HE SAID. "THE
SUN'S SHINING AND I'VE GOT AS MUCH
GRASS AS I CAN EAT."
THE GRASSHOPPER SPENT THE WHOLE
MORNING STUFFING HIS FACE UNTIL HE
COULDN'T EAT ANOTHER THING.
"RIGHT," HE SAID. "NOW I'LL MAKE
SOME MUSIC."
HE RUBBED HIS BACK LEGS AGAINST
HIS WINGS AND MADE A LOUD BUZZING
SOUND.
"LOVELY," SAID THE GRASSHOPPER.
"NOTHING BETTER THAN THE SOUND OF A
HAPPY GRASSHOPPER."
"GIVE IT A REST," SAID A PASSING ANT.
"WHAT?" SAID THE GRASSHOPPER.
"I'M TRYING TO WORK HERE," SAID THE
ANT. "YOU'RE GIVING ME A HEADACHE."
"YOU DON'T LIKE MY MUSIC?" SAID THE
GRASSHOPPER.
"NOT MY KIND OF THING," SAID THE ANT.
"ANYWAY AIN'T GOT TIME TO STAND
AROUND TALKING ABOUT MUSIC. GOT
STUFF TO DO."
"STUFF?" SAID THE GRASSHOPPER. "WHAT
STUFF HAVE YOU GOT TO DO ON A LOVELY
SUNNY MORNING LIKE THIS?"
"GOTTA GET THIS FOOD SHIFTED," SAID
THE ANT.
THE GRASSHOPPER NOTICED THAT THE
ANT WAS DRAGGING ALONG A HUGE EAR
OF CORN.
"THAT LOOKS LIKE HARD WORK, MATE,"
SAID THE GRASSHOPPER.
"TELL ME ABOUT IT," SAID THE ANT.
"WHAT YOU DOING WITH IT?" SAID THE
GRASSHOPPER.
"TAKING IT TO OUR NEST," SAID THE ANT.
"WHAT'RE YOU DOING THAT FOR?"
"FOOD FOR THE WINTER," SAID THE ANT.
"GOTTA GET READY FOR THE WINTER."
"WHY?" SAID THE GRASSHOPPER.
"WINTER WON'T COME FOR AGES. WON'T
BE WINTER TILL...THE WINTER. IT'S
SUMMER NOW. WHY WORRY ABOUT THE
WINTER?"
"WE ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THE WINTER."
SAID THE ANT. "WE SPEND ALL SUMMER
GATHERING UP FOOD FOR THE WINTER.
IT'S WHAT WE ANTS DO."
"IT'S NOT WHAT GRASSHOPPERS DO,"
SAID THE GRASSHOPPER. "WE GRASSHOPPERS KNOW HOW TO ENJOY THE
SUMMER. EAT...SLEEP...MAKE SOME
COOL MUSIC...IT'S A FINE LIFE. WE
GRASSHOPPERS KNOW HOW TO LIVE,
SEE."
"RIGHT," SAID THE ANT. "I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO IT."
"DON'T GO ANT, MATE," SAID THE
GRASSHOPPER. "STICK AROUND. PASS
THE DAY WITH ME."
"SORRY." SAID THE ANT. "LIKE I SAID, I
GOT STUFF TO DO."
THE ANT DRAGGED HIS EAR OF CORN
AND STRUGGLED OFF ACROSS THE FIELD.
"PLEASE YOURSELF," CALLED THE GRASSHOPPER. "I'M NOT BOTHERED. I GOT
STUFF TO DO TOO. GOT ALL THIS GRASS
TO EAT. GOT THE SUN TO ENJOY. NOT
GONNA WASTE A LOVELY DAY LIKE THIS
TALKING TO ANTS."
"HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MORE SILLY
CREATURE THAN AN ANT?" SHOUTED THE
GRASSHOPPER.
IT WAS WINTER. THE GRASSHOPPER WAS
COLD. TOO COLD TO HOP. TOO COLD TO
MAKE HIS MUSIC. AND HE WAS HUNGRY.
HE'D SPENT ALL DAY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO EAT. SUDDENLY HE SAW THE ANT.
"HELLO ANT," HE SHIVERED. "REMEMBER
ME?"
"YEP," SAID THE ANT.
"COLD," ISN'T IT," SAID THE GRASSHOPPER.
"NICE AND WARM IN OUR NEST," SAID
THE ANT.
"NOT SO MUCH TO EAT NOW IS THERE,"
SAID THE GRASSHOPPER
"WE'VE GOT PLENTY," SAID THE ANT.
"OUR STORE ROOMS ARE FULL OF SEEDS
AND CORN. GOT LOADS OF FOOD. ENOUGH
TO SEE US SAFELY THROUGH TO SPRING."
"LOADS OF FOOD, EH?" SAID THE GRASSHOPPER. "LOOK...MATE...I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD...? I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D BE ABLE TO GIVE ME...?"
"YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER SEEN A MORE
SILLY CREATURE THAN AN ANT," SAID THE
ANT.
"I DIDN'T MEAN THAT," SAID THE GRASSHOPPER. "THAT WAS JUST A JOKE. OH
COME ON. JUST A COUPLE OF EARS OF
CORN. YOU CAN SPARE IT. I'VE GOT
NOTHING."
"SORRY...MATE," SAID THE ANT. "IF
YOU SAVE UP ON THE DAYS WHEN YOU
HAVE PLENTY THEN THERE'LL NEVER BE A
DAY WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING."
THE ANT HURRIED DOWN INTO HIS WARM
NEST KNOWING THAT HE'D NEVER EVER
SEE THAT GRASSHOPPER AGAIN. GIBI
