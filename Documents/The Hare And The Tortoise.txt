"LOOK AT ME!" SAID THE HARE TO THE
OTHER ANIMALS. "JUST LOOK HOW FAST I
CAN RUN."
THE HARE RAN ACROSS A FIELD AS FAST
AS HE COULD. ALL THE ANIMALS AGREED
THAT YES THE HARE WAS VERY FAST.
THE HARE RAN BACK.
"SEE," HE SHOUTED. "I'M NOT EVEN OUT"
OF BREATH."
"YEAH, THAT WAS FAST," SAID A FOX.
"SO WHO WANTS A RACE?" SAID THE
HARE. "ANYBODY THINK THEY COULD
BEAT ME?"
NONE OF THE ANIMALS SPOKE.
"SEE," SAID THE HARE. "YOU'RE ALL TOO
SCARED TO EVEN TRY."
"I'LL HAVE A GO," SAID THE TORTOISE.
THE HARE LAUGHED. "YOU? THE SLOWEST CREATURE IN THE WHOLE WORLD?
I'M NOT WASTING MY TIME RACING A
TORTOISE."
"WHAT'S THE MATTER?" SAID THE
TORTOISE. "SCARED I MIGHT BEAT YOU?"
SOME OF THE ANIMALS LAUGHED AT
THAT SO THE HARE SAID, "ALRIGHT THEN,
TORTOISE. LET'S HAVE A RACE...RIGHT
NOW...THEN WE'LL SEE WHO'S LAUGHING."
"NOT TODAY," SAID THE TORTOISE. "WE'LL
RACE NEXT WEEK. GOT TO DO A BIT OF
TRAINING FIRST."
NEXT MORNING THE ANIMALS WATCHED
THE TORTOISE DO HIS "TRAINING". FIRST
HE DID SOME GENTLE STRETCHING EXERCISES TO WARM HIMSELF UP...
...AND THEN HE STARTED TO RUN.
"HAS HE STARTED RUNNING YET?" ASKED
THE FOX.
"HARD TO TELL WITH TORTOISES," SAID THE
BADGER. "HE'S DEFINITELY MOVING."
"IS HE?" SAID THE FOX.
"TORTOISE, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?"
SAID THE CROW. "I MEAN THE HARE IS
VERY FAST AND YOU…WELL…"
"DON'T WORRY," SAID THE TORTOISE.
"THIS IS JUST DAY ONE. I'LL SPEED UP.
YOU'LL SEE."
ON THE DAY OF THE RACE CROWDS OF
ANIMALS CAME TO WATCH. THE
TORTOISE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY TO
THE STARTING LINE AND THEN
SUDDENLY...
...THE HARE ARRIVED AT TOP SPEED
WEARING A BRAND NEW TRACK SUIT AND
FOUR EXPENSIVE-LOOKING TRAINERS.
"THE RACE STARTS HERE." SAID THE FOX
POINTING TO A LINE ON THE GROUND.
"AND ENDS AT THAT TREE ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE FIELD. FIRST ONE TO TOUCH
THE TREE IS THE WINNER."
"RIGHT, LET'S GET ON WITH IT," SAID THE
HARE. "READY TORTOISE? READY TO
SEE SOME REAL SPEED?"
"I'M READY," SAID THE TORTOISE.
"READY, STEADY...GO!" SAID THE
FOX AND THE RACE BEGAN.
THE HARE ROARED OFF THEN STOPPED
AND LOOKED BACK. THE TORTOISE WAS
STILL CROSSING THE STARTING LINE. THE
HARE RAN BACK TO THE TORTOISE.
"DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM SAY GO? YOU
CAN START, YOU KNOW."
"I HAVE STARTED," SAID THE TORTOISE.
"LOOK," SAID THE HARE. "YOU'RE GOING
SO SLOWLY I'M GOING TO HAVE A REST.
MIGHT EVEN HAVE A LITTLE SLEEP. I'LL
FINISH THE RACE WHEN I WAKE UP AND
STILL BEAT YOU BY MILES."
THE HARE LAY DOWN IN THE SUN AND
FELL ASLEEP. THE TORTOISE KEPT GOING.
SLOWLY, STEADILY HE MOVED ACROSS
THE FIELD AND BY EVENING TIME HE
WAS GETTING CLOSE TO THE FINISHING
TREE. STILL THE HARE SLEPT ON AND
NOW THE ANIMALS STARTED TO GET
EXCITED.
"YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK HE MIGHT
WIN," SAID A RABBIT.
"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT," SAID THE BADGER.
"THE TORTOISE MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN."
THE ANIMALS STARTED TO GET EXCITED
AND AS THE TORTOISE GOT CLOSE TO THE
FINISHING TREE THEY STARTED TO CHEER.
"COME ON TORTOISE," THEY SHOUTED.
"NEARLY THERE. KEEP GOING OLD
FRIEND. KEEP GOING."
BUT THE NOISE OF THE CHEERING CROWD
WOKE UP THE HARE. HE LOOKED
ACROSS THE FIELD, SAW THE TORTOISE
ABOUT TO REACH THE TREE AND IN A
FLASH HE WAS RUNNING.
THE TORTOISE HEARD THE HARE THUNDERING UP BEHIND HIM BUT HE KEPT
GOING...AND GOING...AND SUDDENLY
HE WAS THERE. JUST IN TIME THE
TORTOISE TOUCHED THE TREE WITH
HIS NOSE. HE'D DONE IT. THE TORTOISE
HAD BEATEN THE HARE FAIR AND
SQUARE.
"THERE YOU GO," SAID THE BADGER.
"SLOW AND STEADY'S SOMETIMES BETTER THAN FAST AND FLASHY."
"NOT FAIR," SAID THE HARE. "I WAS
ASLEEP. WE HAVE TO RUN THE RACE
AGAIN. IT'S NOT FAIR."
BUT NO-ONE WAS LISTENING TO THE
HARE. GIBI DIBI
